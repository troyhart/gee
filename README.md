Good Enterprise Examples -- A simple prototype application with a gradle build.

This project is meant to demonstrate some of good features of the JEE platform. I have put it together as a form of 
reference for myself, because I increasingly rely on examples to remember some of the subtle details of the things I 
do infrequently. I am also motivated to demonstrate how simple the JEE platform has become with the release of version 
6 of the api.

I also intend to tease out some continuous delivery concerns that I am presently thinking about at my day job. This 
includes a build pipleline driven by TeamCity, implemented with gradle, and backed by git and artifactory.

Finally, I hope to virtualize server configuration with vagrant and puppet in order to provide a complete deployment 
environment for the application.
